# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a simple implementation of a Rock, Paper, Scissors game, in which the user can play against the computer for a game of 2 out of 3 (adjusted from a 5-Round game in an effort for simplicity and a quicker, slightly more realistic match). The purpose of this project is to practice some simple JavaScript, but with more to come in the near future.
